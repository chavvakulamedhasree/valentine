Happy Valentine’s Day uncle 💖<br><br>

I just wanted to say thank you… really.  
Thank you for always being there whenever I get stuck with incidents.  
No matter how many times I ask, you never say no.  
You always help me patiently — and honestly, you are one of the main reasons I’m still surviving in this project 😌✨  

You are not just a manager… you are the kind of leader who treats team problems like your own problems.  
That’s something very rare. And I truly admire that about you.  

Even though your voice sounds a little scary sometimes 😂  
I know you are actually a very kind and caring person inside.  

Also… you and your Dil Pasand situation 🙄  
You never share it with anyone! Very bad behaviour sir 😤😂  

And yes… I know I always make you say sorry even when you did nothing wrong.  
But I enjoy it too much when you say “sorry” 😌  
So you have no choice — you must continue saying sorry to me forever.  

I like teasing you… a lot 😈  
Making fun of you is one of my favourite hobbies.  
And honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever stop doing that.  

Sometimes I get a little jealous also…  
I want you to be close only to me, not to others — not even Raj 😏  
Don’t ask why… I just don’t like it 😌  

Even if one day we go to different projects…  
I will never forget you.  
You will always be my chweeett bajji 🥹💛  

Thank you for guiding me, supporting me, and tolerating me.  
You are truly the best manager.  

Luv u my cutiee uncle 💕
